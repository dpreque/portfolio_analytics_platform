# Securities service : read-side lookups over dim_entity (+ dim_security and its
# equity/fund/bond extensions) for the price-viewer picker. asset_class is
# derived from which extension table the security lives in (the real schema has
# no single asset_class column); ISIN comes from dim_entity_identifiers.
